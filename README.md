# Project4_CosmoTransition
A package for analyzing finite or zero-temperature cosmological phase transitions driven by single or multiple scalar fields.

The CosmoTransitions package is a set of python modules for calculating properties of effective potentials with one or more scalar fields. Most importantly, it can be used to find the instanton solutions which interpolate between different vacua in a given theory, allowing one to determine the probability for a vacuum transition.

### Installation:

CosmoTransitions can be installed via pip using pip install

`pip install ComsoTransitions`

cosmoTransitions for both Python 2 and Python 3. You can also install the package manually by downloading the source and putting the 'cosmoTransitions' folder somewhere in your path. Then from a python prompt you should be able to import cosmoTransitions and run the code. 

CosmoTransitions makes extensive use of numpy and scipy, and the plotting functions use matplotlib.
